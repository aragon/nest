# Aragon Nest Program: Frequently Asked Questions

## Overview 

The Nest program exists to help teams innovate with governance at the speed of software and build unstoppable organizations.

We do this in 3 ways:
- **Ideation:** we will help you validate and refine your ideas. This includes feedback on initial proposals as well as help understanding the Aragon stack so that you can realize your dreams on the platform.
- **Funding:** we will provide you with capital to build out your ideas. This will be delivered in 3 phases: ⅓ up front to start work, ⅓ upon the delivery of a successful prototype, ⅓ upon shipment of a production ready product to mainnet.
- **Support Network:** shipping is hard. Once your prototype is working, we will help you get user feedback, security audits, and legal council so that you can ship a production ready application to end users. 

We are dedicated to helping humanity organize, coordinate, and collaborate at scale. Join us in fighting for freedom. Let’s buidl the future together.

### General FAQs

[formatting tdd]

How much are the Nest Grants? 
The minimum grant size is USD 5,000 and the maximum grant size is 150,000. In addition, grantees are able to apply for a success bonus of 50,000 ANT. The average size of an Aragon Nest grant is USD [insert] and [insert] ANT. 
If the amount of funding you are looking for is under USD 5,000, your project may be better suited to the Aragon Community Fund DAO (CFDAO)
What does Aragon get for supporting projects via the Nest program? Does it get tokens/equity from the grantees?
No tokens and no equity. We ask for nothing in return from the grantees outside of delivering the promised solution. 
How do I find more information about Nest? Is there a website?
The GitHub repository is the main source of information about the program. However, you can find additional information in the project's website.
How much white powder has Aragon earmarked for Nest grants?
? 
Do you take board seats? 
No. But in order to best support the projects we provide grants too, we do require relevant information concerning the ongoing status of your project. As such, there are certain information requirements that grantee projects must comply with. 
When is the right time to approach Aragon for a Nest grant? 
We encourage projects and teams of all sizes and stages to apply for Nest. This can include prototypes that are pre-launch to fully established organisations and projects that want to integrate with Aragon. The only exception is that Nest grants are not suitable for projects that are purely research related in nature. 
Pre-Application
Eligibility for Grants 
How do I find out if my project could be eligible for a grant?
Check the Proposals for grants for existing proposals. If you don’t find anything close to what you’re working on, submit a new proposal for a grant and discuss if we should consider it for a grant
See the Guide for submitting a new request for funding and follow these steps:
Fork the Aragon Nest GitHub repository
Create a new directory with your project’s name inside the grants/ folder. 
Inside that, create two files, team.md and roadmap.md, where you present your team and suggested roadmap
Create a Pull Request to merge your submission into the Nest repository. In that Pull Request, be sure to fill in all the relevant info described in the Guide for submitting a new request for funding
Proposals should abstractly describe problems or products, not their implementations
I’m working on something that already has an existing proposal?
If there is an existing proposal for a grant or funded project that is close to your idea, join in the discussion of that proposal to see if your proposal could be integrated into the existing one, or if you should create a new proposal
My project is for-profit. Can I still apply? 
No, your project won’t be eligible for a Nest grant. We only fund projects that are 100% for the benefit of the Aragon ecosystem. Funding for-profit projects where Aragon does not hold equity or tokens would not be aligned the interests of ANT stakeholders. 
You may however be interested in using Aragon Fundraising. 
My project will be used across other platforms in addition to Aragon. Can I still apply?
Generally, we want the lion’s share of the reward of the project to accrue to ANT stakeholders, which means utilizing the Aragon ecosystem. We will however consider rare exceptions on a case by case basis if they are deemed of exceptional importance to the wider ecosystem. 
Do you fund research?
No. But the Aragon Community Fund DAO (CFDAO) does. 
Do you provide grants to single founders?
 ? 
Do you provide grants to non-technical projects? 
Absolutely. Whilst most of the grants we make are technical in nature, we are equally excited to back non-technical projects that meet our grant requirements.  
Do you have pre-existing Requests for Nest Projects?  
There is an Aragon Wishlist which includes features and project ideas that community members have expressed a desire to see implemented on Aragon. Many of these are suitable to Nest Projects. 
Application Process
How to submit a proposal for a grant?
Create a new Proposal for grants at the Nest Repository and fill it out in detail following the Guide for submitting a proposal for grants (A Github account is required)
How does the application process works?
There are 5 stages to the grant process: 
Submission - The information submitted on your application allows us to get a quick overview of the project to see if there is a fit
Initial Review - Assigned leads will review your application after which they will notify you if we are progressing the application to the next stage in our process or not
Lead Call -  If your project looks like a good fit, you’ll be invited for a call with the lead. This is our chance to learn more about each other in a more personal way
Community Evaluation - During this stage, we’ll ask the Aragon community for feedback on your project. Expect numerous back and forths as we deep dive into your project and team. 
Community Vote - The final stage. Members of the NestDAO will be asked to vote on whether or not we fund your project. If it’s a yes, you’ll be sent a legal agreement to sign and the funds will be transferred to you within 3 days of signing the agreement.
Who will be deciding on how the grants are distributed?
When you make the initial submission, you will be asked to select a maximum of 3 leads that you would like to review your project. Your project will be assigned to one of these leads who will review it (Initial Review). View a list of all Nest Leads. 
During the “Community Evaluation” phase, anyone from the Aragon community will be able to engage in the evaluation of your project. In practice, this means anyone with a Github account. 
The Community Vote phase is limited to members of the Aragon NestDAO. This includes members with a deep level understanding of the Aragon ecosystem and is currently invite-only. View a list of the current members. 
The funding will be described in the proposal and request for funding stages of the grant. The total amount, how many portions will it be divided into, timetable and milestones will be up for discussion with the relevant team.
How long until I get feedback on my application (Stage 2: Initial Review)?
You can expect the requested lead to respond within 72 hours of your submission. 
How long does the entire grant process to take. 
For projects that successfully pass each 5 stages, we aim to complete the process within 1 month.
Post-Application
How will the funds be released to the grantees?
All payments will be made in cryptocurrencies. The grants will be paid in DAI and released in portions according to the agreed roadmap (and deliverables) that the team has submitted in their proposal. A possible reward depending on total project completion will be given in ANT to reward value created for the Aragon Network and to enable the participation in the governance of the project.
Do you have standard legal documents that you use between Aragon Association and the Nest team? 
Yes, you will receive a standardised grantee agreement that you will be expected to sign. View a template of this agreement. 
Who needs to sign this legal agreement? 
A legal entity has to sign a legal document. This could be an individual or a company. In cases where there are multiple individuals on the Nest team, all individuals will need to sign this document. 
How will funding be delivered?
⅓ upon approval. ⅓ upon delivery of a working prototype. ⅓ upon delivery of a finished product.
What support can grantees expect from the Nest program besides financial backing?
Aragon is one of the most skilled projects in the crypto community. The development teams are formed by talented engineers that will be supporting the engineers working on the Nest projects. Also, we have developed experience, and crafted best practices, on how crypto projects should be run. We want to help expand the experience and best practices as much as possible.
