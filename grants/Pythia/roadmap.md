# Pythia Roadmap

### September 2018
1. A live testnet version that only supports ether bounties and deposits
2. A simplified court system for demonstration purposes

### December 2018

1. Support for ERC20 bounties and deposits added.
2. Integration into the Aragon Court System (provided it exists on a test net)
    * If the Aragon Court System doesn't exist on a test net then a mock plugin version will be used

### February 2019
1. Version 1 launched on main net.
2. Use of a DEX interface to convert deposits into ANT tokens for use in the Aragon Court System
3. Full integration into the Aragon Court System.
4. A decent front end single page app (almost certainly React based) that provides an easy to navigate workflow for users who have metamask but who don't want to think of anything under the hood. Specifically, would be oracles should not need any knowledge of Ethereum beyond being able to use a wallet.

### Beyond February 2019 (bonus feature)
1. A judiciary agnostic interface to allow users to bring their own judiciary, provided
    a) it conforms to the Pythia standards for a judiciary
    b) it cedes supreme power to the Aragon Court System
