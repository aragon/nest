        1. DApp controls and routing
        1. Implement full feature set in Bastet and UI
        1. Hardware wallet integration
    1. Code audits and other security
    1. User testing / feedback

1. __Release Candidate implementation__
    1. Finalize interfaces / APIs

### Schedule:

Estimated total time: __3-4 Quarters__

I expect Milestones 1 & 2 to occupy about 2 Quarters (with `1 < 2`),
at which point `RC.v1.0.0` can be cut.
There will be a first end-to-end prototype within a month.
