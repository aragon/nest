# Wespr / Pando Team

### Olivier - Lead Developer

Developer and former Ph.D. Student in computer sciences at Centrale/Supélec. Olivier has worked on various open source projects before he dropped his Ph.D. because the institution funding him refused that he publishes his softwares under Open Source licences. He then developed a passion for philosophy. In 2015 he defends a Ph.D. Thesis in Communication Sciences on web-based decentralized organizations and the mode of being of the crowds on which they  rule. Olivier is now Professor in Communication Sciences at University Rennes 2 where he discusses the economical, sociological and philosophical implications of distributed organizations and blockchain technologies. When he is not at the University, Olivier spends most of his spare time writing smart contracts to make his political fantasies come true. Olivier will resign from University as april 2018 to focus on the development of pando.
