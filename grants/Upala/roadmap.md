# Upala roadmap

Research is done in three stages: requirements, brainstorming, and assembly. Results of every research topic will be posted on Medium and Reddit for discussion ([examples](https://airtable.com/shrNQ0VClgqBiHmkL)).

__System requirements (4 weeks):__
- Ideal user experience
- Ideal customer experience (customers - services requesting user data)
- Attacks and special cases (real twins, frequent travelers, plastic surgery, the lonely, etc. - test cases for the system)

__Brainstorming components (8 weeks):__
- Initiatives (who pays, who earns, who's punished, what users are required to do)
- Face recognition and privacy
- Location proof without FOAM
- Reputation mechanism
- Account recovery mechanism
- Other ([see here](https://airtable.com/shrNQ0VClgqBiHmkL))

__Assembly (4 weeks):__
- Whitepaper ([early draft](https://upala-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html))

__Total: 16 weeks (4 months).__
