# Roadmap

### 1 Month
Draft / Whitepaper / Docs of the system
- explains the core components of the system and outlines what they need to do
  - web2 => web3 identity
  - web2 => web3 data transfer and verification
  - web3 mechanisms for voting and trading => action on web2 platforms/communities that use the mechanism (for example a subreddit that chooses to make their decisions from the web3 votes of the community)

### 3 Months
An oracle/validator model that connects data from web2 platforms to web3 contracts/markets
- A system that can be managed by the participants of the data network in a social/cryptoeconomic manner rather than an arbitrary 3rd party. This reduces 3rd party risk and allows a community to bootstrap the protocol rather than being constrained by what 3rd parties do or don't support.

### 6 Months
A live demo: the decentralized dohnut protocol
- Shows how the whole thing works and provides a template for people/communities to learn about and start testing bridging their web2 experiences to web3 opportunities (this will be like the /r/ethtrader donuts, but actually decentralized).
- The template will also come with a toolkit for quickly building and experimenting with cryptoeconomic voting, governance, and incentivization mechanisms (building blocks for social decentralized communities).

Note: timeline subject to change based on Polkadot/Ethereum progress, delays, or roadblocks.
