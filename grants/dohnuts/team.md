### Me: Burrrata

I read a lot, and think a lot. From what I can tell, it seems that cooperation is the fundamental thing that has allowed humans to overcome major difficulties and become the dominant species on the planet. For a while this worked really well in tribes where people knew each other and established reputation, and ten in top down command and control systems where one gov/religion would coordinate all it’s members to get stuff done (build churches/pyramids, invade less coordinated small tribes, etc…).

Today though, we live in a global 24/7 interconnected world where these institutions are ill-equipped to take on our current challenges such as environmental challenges (tragedy of the commons), border-less culture/businesses/information (permission-less innovation), and a general inability for people to secure or verify information and value (and thus make informed decisions). We cannot solve these problems with the same level of thinking that created them, but we can evolve our coordination mechanisms to meet these demands.

This is where cryptoeconomics comes in: it’s an evolution of human cooperation. My goal is to better understand cryptoeconomic mechanisms in order to contribute in some small way to helping people get along. History has shown that this is possible, and the species, cultures, and societies that understood this are the ones that survived and thrived. Mars is cool, but I want to have fun here on earth too.

### Everyone Else

Ideally this project will be open to the community as soon as possible so that people can start hacking and experimenting. Ideally it's like a big box full of legos that people can start playing with to try stuff out. If they don't see what they want they can submit proposals or build it themselves. I really want to enable creative experiments that make the transition from web2 => web3 organic and fun :)
