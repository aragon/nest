Bitrophone / Online Music Distribution Service

What we aim? What are the features? 

We aim to be biggest music distribution service that utilizes blockchain & accepts cryptocurrency for payment & private payments. 
Bitrophone will be an app/website that utilizes $ANT as main currency.

I (Caner Sevince) personally worked in couple projects in blockchain space but none of them had confident in theirself, to become one of the biggest services at online music industry. After some time they became deactive or went offline.

How is this project works?

1 Musician pays subscription cost to Bitrophone using $ANT (from various subscription options).

2 Musician gets “Subscriber” account title after network confirmation.

3 Musician gets rights to upload song & audios & artwork.

4 Uploaded song & audios & artwork goes to conversion in order to get high quality & compressed files as the music stores want.

5 Bitrophone delivers uploaded content to music stores such as Spotify, iTunes, Deezer, Youtube, Google Play Music and Bitrophone Music App.

6 Stores verify and check for any copyright issues.

7 Accepted songs will be released on platforms.

8 Stores deliver stream reports every 2-3 months.

9 With the royalty earning reports come from stores, Bitrophone buys $ANT from exchanges.

10 Musicians will be able to withdraw their earnings from Bitrophone(9↑) website.

11 Every 6th month Bitrophone buys $ANT with %50 of the profit made from subscribed users.

12 Service users and musicians of community gets promoted by our curators in our website & blogs.






What problem we solve?

Slow transactions in music industry between artists and their labels
Low earning rate for musicians/high fees
Release of music takes 
Too much time in free services & even in paid ones
Expensive distribution services
Copyright issues while covering songs
Improving the marketing for ANT & market liquidity
An awesome use case, music industry is very big :)
