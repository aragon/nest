## **ROADMAP**

#### Objective

Merging the real üåé and üåê virtual worlds, by bridging Wyoming and Aragon üåÑüåâü¶Ö

This roadmap offers methods for connecting **etheric** and **legal** entities

* **Context** section lists the foundations for the bridge
* **Milestones** contains blueprints to **#BuildTheBridge**
* For how the bizarre political climate of Wyoming supports **hybrid entities**, check out the full Aragon  Nest proposal [here](https://cryptpad.fr/code/#/2/code/view/FOdQ1K-S40bhO6ESzODiKxetdkyRIHic+eHloZviZ7c/)

##### Summary

We propose making legalüîõvirtual interactions more accessible via:

* **Etherize.It**, a user interface for **creating** and **managing hybrid entities**
* Ethereum & Aragon code for **incorporating**, linking, and operating **legal entities**
* Extensible **legal templates** for operating agreements, amendments, and contracts
* **Permissions suite** for regulating interactions between Aragonian and legal entities  

*While this proposal is designed with Aragonü¶Ö, Ethereumü¶Ñ, and WyomingüåÑ in mind, universality is a priority.*

##### Context

Aragonü¶Ö is a collection of code sufficient for incorporating **etheric entities** such as DAOs, DACs, or whatever you like to call 'Them'üëΩ.

Aragon has a number of decentralized apps including the [Agent](http://blog.aragon.one/aragon-agent-beta-release/)(üë§‚ö°), which is able to execute **etheric code** (smart contracts). Each Aragon entity (DAO) can have multiple Agents, and permissions-based restrictions will limit which Agents can execute which etheric code.

[OpenLaw](https://openlaw.io) is a platform that can execute etheric code once a customizable, human-readable contract is signed by all parties.   ü¶Ñ ‚úï ‚öñ

## Milestones

Detailed Roadmap with proposed implementation can be found [here](https://cryptpad.fr/code/#/2/code/view/P0ObcNhRqSKTVtacdCvMTw-H7E7Hf+e9Fm9Tg5tBTA4/).

### 1. Foundation
###### *Month 3 - $10k*

*Upon completion, Ethereum users may..*

* **declare** and **confirm relations** to **other entities**
* **designate identities** for **countersigning**
* **incorporate** an **LLC** with  ETH or DAI

*.. via smart contracts or a user interface at **Etherize.It.** *

### 2. Structure
###### *Month 4 - $10k*

*Upon completion, any Aragon entity (DAO) may..*

* **execute** and suspend  **legal/etheric contracts**
* recursively **declare**  **relations** to **other entities**

*.. through OpenLaw/AragonCLI integration*


### 3. Tension
###### *Month 6 - $8k*

*Upon completion, any Aragon entity (DAO) may..*

* designate **Agents** to **manage** a set of **legal entities**
* declare its **tokens** equivalent to **stock certificates**[*]( https://wyoleg.gov/Legislation/2019/HB0185)

*.. through Aragon Agent integration*

### 4. Bridge
###### *Month 8 - $12k*

*Upon completion, one may readily..*

* create, manage, and operate **legal entities** through virtual means
* craft **hybrid entities** spanning the Wyoming and Aragon jurisdictions
* set consistent **identities & permissions** throughout legal and etheric systems

*.. using Agent UI, Etherize.It, or underlying smart contracts*

### Epilogue

The stability of a bridge permits sharing resources across legal and virtual jurisdictions.

The chasm between real-world pragmatics and magical unicorn thinking is crossed. The riches of both worlds may flow over, in between, and into each other, as peoples' ideas for revolutionary dapps is no longer struck dead by the inefficiencies of going between.  

Much of what this proposal presents as possible is dependent upon the maturation of jurisdictions across the planet.

Wyoming has shown us what may be possible, but it will take a community to build a meaningful connection between the virtual and real worlds. The real bridge between the legal and virtual world was just us humans, all this time.

$5k worth of ANT from this Nest proposal will be used to incentivize the incorporation of legal entity/blockchain hybrid entities, regardless of how or where they maintain their jurisdictions.

Access to banking services for DAOs will become streamlined, via the Wyoming State-Chartered Bank.

Etherize.It grows into a comprehensive resource for creating and managing hybrid entities, on a growing number of jurisdictions. Additional services such as notarization and take-down requests are added.

Etherize.It will be entirely open source and built using Lorikeet(AragonUI), making its hybrid management features easily integrated into future Aragon client releases.
