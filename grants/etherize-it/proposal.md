##### *An Interface between the Real üåé and üåê Virtual Worlds*
**Aragon Nest Proposal #48:** [DAOs and the interaction with the physical world ](https://github.com/aragon/nest/issues/48)

### Abstract

¬†¬† Decentralized organizations are capable of coordinating behavior and resources globally, but face many challenges when interacting with the 'real' world.  

How can decentralized entities leverage existing legal systems, rather than fear them?

This proposal offers ways for legal and decentralized entities to connect; e.g. executing legal contracts after tokenholders have voted accordingly.

 It will allow decentralized organizations to become hybrid entities, by tying their tokens to a corporation's stock certificates, unlocking new potentials while likely shielding participants from personal liability.

Furthermore it will allow decentralized organizations to appoint managers, who are able to execute both legal and smart contracts on behalf of the organization.

 By paving the way for hybrid organizations and their agents, we can sprout etheric cooperatives capable of challenging the mightiest of leviathans.


 #### Deliverables

 The Bridge is made of ethericü¶Ñ, Aragonü¶Ö, and legal‚öñ code.

 *  Tools for universally linking entities
¬†* Permission sets for regulating interactions between entities
 *   Code for creating and managing legal entities
 * Extensible template contracts and operating agreements ([OpenLaw](https://openlaw.io))


 *While this proposal is designed with Aragonü¶Ö, Ethereumü¶Ñ, and WyomingüåÑ in mind, universality is a priority. For more details, see  [Roadmap](https://cryptpad.fr/code/#/2/code/view/P0ObcNhRqSKTVtacdCvMTw-H7E7Hf+e9Fm9Tg5tBTA4/)*.

 "The Portal between the Real and Virtual")

## Background
There have always been ways to connect the real and virtual worlds. As anyone seeking to convert crypto to cash can tell you, there is often a great deal of energy wasted in the exchange.

 While dealing with decentralized organizations today comes with encumbrance, many of us feel that once these interactions flow with grace, all the ***Decentralization!***  hype may finally be worth it.

 We can reduce the energy wasted going back and forth between these two worlds, by building a bridge through an apporpriate portal.

 In a place that [many believe is fiction](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23WyomingDoesntExist), just such a portal between the virtual and real worlds has been opening up.

 This proposal calls for the construction of a bridge, so that entities can reliably traverse through this portal; so that it does not take an inordinate amount of effort for legal and decentralized entities to deal with one another.

  The bridge will be anchored in Wyoming and Aragon, which will act as gateways to the 'real' and 'virtual' worlds, much like the Portuguese trading ports once did in  Japan.  We have an opportunity for cross pollination if trust can be built between these communities.

 Other portals will surely be opening through progressive legislation, and the tools developed during this project will be easily repurposed for bridging other jurisdictions.

Interactions between legal and decentralized entities can be made regular. Exotic hybrids, like DAO/LLCs, can be made commonplace. The real and virtual worlds can be made into one, enabling cooperation at an inconceivable scale.

#### WHYoming?

The State of Wyoming recognizes cryptocurrency as untaxed property[*](https://twitter.com/CaitlinLong_/status/1096116466259116032), holds cryptotokens as potentially equivalent to stock certificates[*](https://wyoleg.gov/Legislation/2019/HB0185), and permits humans to control legal entities by signing statements with their public key[*](https://legiscan.com/WY/bill/HB0101/2018).

  Prospective legislation would create a sandbox for fintech startups[*](https://wyoleg.gov/Legislation/2019/HB0057), create a state-chartered bank[*](https://www.wyoleg.gov/InterimCommittee/2018/09-2018112919LSO-0055v0.8.pdf) for providing fiat services to crypto projects, and pressure the Secretary of State to open its API by 2020.

   All of this legislation has made Wyoming an ideal place for building a bridge between the virtual and real worlds.¬†A more detailed analysis is provided [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dLkHGE-h_5Cpfy0Lq2DxLahBwKkqeyOp8pUTDrsSCNg/edit?usp=sharing).

#### Proof-of-Concept
   '[Etherize.It](https://devpost.com/software/etherize-it-daosprout)' concept was first developed during the Wyoming Hackathon. It was selected as the winner of the Consensys prize.

   A proof-of-concept for DAO<->LLC interaction by [Ross Campbell](https://twitter.com/r_ross_campbell), using Aragon and OpenLaw, can be found [here](https://blog.goodaudience.com/e-commerce-with-legal-and-blockchain-security-6f2ba6c244a3).

#### Grant size
**$75k in ETH or DAI**
$35k up front for dedicated team member salaries; $40k over deliverables

**$25k in ANT**
Bonus for completion of project, of which $5k will be used to incentivize the first 50 hybrid entity registrations

#### Legal Structure
   The team will 'dogfood' the hybrid entity creation process by incorporating a Series LLC in Wyoming that is managed by a Multisig Aragon DAO. Step-by-step tutorials for replicating the hybridization process will be published as part of this proposal.

   The Series LLC, 'Sprout', will create child LLCs with obligations to participate in a wealth sharing network. One of Sprout's child LLCs, **EtherizeIt**, will offer hybrid entity creation and management services.

#### Etherize.It: üñπ + ü¶Ñ = üíé
While distributed network/legal corporation **hybrid entities** üíªü§ù‚öñ have been possible for years, a number of hurdles have blocked the path towards proliferationüö´ü¶Ñ. That time is endingüîú‚åõ.

   While many can feel the oncoming wave of decentralization, few have been able to reap the seeds that have been sown. Etherize.It seeks to change that, by aggregating services into one user-friendly hub.
   * The cornerstone of this platform is the creation and maintenance of hybrid entities: organizational structures with legal and distributed aspects.
   * Additional services and expansions to crypto-friendly jurisdictions will be added following the completion of this project.
   * Etherize.It will be open-source and developed using Lorikeet so that a maximal amount of its code can be reused by Aragon developers in future client releases.


#### *Open Source/For Profit Disclosure*
¬†*All code pertaining to this proposal and 'Etherize.It' more broadly will be open source. All Aragon functions will be made available at gas cost on Etherize.It in perpetuity. Additional functionalities, such as LLC incorporation and fiat to gas conversion, will likely be subject to additional charges.*

¬†*By the project's completion, as much functionality as possible will be made  available¬†irrespective of platform. E.g., supplying the user with Ethereum bytecode so that they may notarize a document without relying upon Etherize.It/MetaMask, or to declare their DAO's linkage to an LLC, even if that DAO is not created using Aragon.*

#### *Other Disclosures*

*Personal Liability: Although designating a DAO or DAO tokenholders as owners of an LLC is believed by the authors of this proposal to shield participants from personal liability, this remains uncertain until legal precedents are set.*

*Financial Services: Streamlined DAO access to banking services is dependent upon the state-chartered bank legislation being passed. Fully pseudonymous access to US banking services remains unlikely.*
