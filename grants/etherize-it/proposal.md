**Aragon Nest Proposal #48:** [DAOs and the interaction with the physical world ⚖🔛💻](https://github.com/aragon/nest/issues/48)

### Abstract

   Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) are capable of coordinating behavior and resources globally, but face many challenges when interacting with the 'real' world. Opening bank accounts, entering into contractual agreements, and limiting the liability of DAO participants are different sides of the same problem:

   How can legal, human, and decentralized entities traverse between worlds?


 In a place [many believe is fiction](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23WyomingDoesntExist), a portal between the virtual and real worlds has opened.


![The Portal](http://aitheric.com/images/portal-s.jpg
 "The Portal between the Real and Virtual")

 Wyoming has permitted blockchain addresses to control legal entities. This is an unprecedented doorway between worlds: a DAO can make a contract with a legal entity, and have it be enforced by a government.

 This proposal calls for the construction of a bridge so that entities can safely traverse through this portal. The bridge will be anchored in Wyoming and Aragon, which will act as ports to the 'real' and 'virtual' worlds.

 Other windows will surely be opening, and the tools developed during this project will be easily repurposed for bridging other jurisdictions.

 Interactions between legal and decentralized entities can be made regular. Exotic hybrids, like DAO/LLCs, can be made commonplace. The real and virtual worlds can be made into one, enabling cooperation at an inconceivable scale. 🤯



#### Deliverables

The Bridge is made of etheric🦄, Aragon🦅, and legal⚖ code.

   * Tools for universally linking entities 🦄🦅⚖
   * Permission sets for regulating interactions between entities 🦅⚖
   * Code for creating 🦄 and managing🦅 legal entities
   * Template contracts and operating agreements ⚖([OpenLaw](https://openlaw.io))
   * Primers for both Aragonians and legal professionals 🦅⚖

*While this proposal is designed with Aragon🦅, Ethereum🦄, and Wyoming🌄 in mind, universality is a priority.*


####  Roadmap

   [Blueprints](https://cryptpad.fr/code/#/2/code/view/P0ObcNhRqSKTVtacdCvMTw-H7E7Hf+e9Fm9Tg5tBTA4/) for building the bridge.

#### WHYoming?

The State of Wyoming recognizes cryptocurrency as untaxed property[*](https://twitter.com/CaitlinLong_/status/1096116466259116032), holds cryptotokens as potentially equivalent to stock certificates[*](https://wyoleg.gov/Legislation/2019/HB0185), and permits blockchain addresses to control legal entities by signing statements with their public key[*](https://legiscan.com/WY/bill/HB0101/2018).

  Prospective legislation would create a sandbox for fintech startups[*](https://wyoleg.gov/Legislation/2019/HB0057), create a state-chartered bank[*](https://www.wyoleg.gov/InterimCommittee/2018/09-2018112919LSO-0055v0.8.pdf) for providing fiat services to crypto projects, and compel the Secretary of State to open its API by 2020.

   All of this legislation has made Wyoming an ideal place for building a bridge between the virtual and real worlds. A more detailed analysis is provided [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dLkHGE-h_5Cpfy0Lq2DxLahBwKkqeyOp8pUTDrsSCNg/edit?usp=sharing).

#### Proof-of-Concept
   '[Etherize.It](https://devpost.com/software/etherize-it-daosprout)' concept was first developed during the Wyoming Hackathon. It was selected as the winner of the Consensys prize.

   A proof-of-concept for DAO<->LLC interaction by [Ross Campbell](https://twitter.com/r_ross_campbell), using Aragon and OpenLaw, can be found [here](https://blog.goodaudience.com/e-commerce-with-legal-and-blockchain-security-6f2ba6c244a3).

#### Grant size
**$50k in ETH or DAI**

$25k up front, $40k over deliverables

**$25k in ANT**

Upon completion of project, of which $5k will be used as a rebate for the first 50 hybrid entity (e.g. DAO/LLC) registrations

#### Timeline
Project's timeline estimated at eight months ($5k~/month)

#### Team
4 core contributors + legal consultants

[Roster](https://cryptpad.fr/code/#/2/code/view/dpl0dqitZstlQsc+7gtyDULMBnmKDzEMd2FZznuHGQM/)

#### Legal Structure
   The team will 'dogfood' the hybrid entity creation process by incorporating a Series LLC in Wyoming that is managed by a Multisig Aragon DAO. Step-by-step tutorials for replicating the hybridization process will be published as part of this proposal.

#### Etherize.It: 🖹 + 🦄 = 💎
While distributed network/legal corporation **hybrid entities** 💻🤝⚖ have been possible for years, a number of hurdles have blocked the path towards proliferation🚫🦄. That time is ending🔜⌛.

   While many can feel the oncoming wave of decentralization, few have been able to reap the seeds that have been sown. Etherize.It seeks to change that, by aggregating services into one user-friendly hub.
   * The cornerstone of this platform is the creation and maintenance of hybrid entities: organizational structures with legal and distributed aspects.
   * Additional services and expansions to crypto-friendly jurisdictions will be added following the completion of this project.
   * Etherize.It will be open-source and developed using Lorikeet so that a maximal amount of its code can be reused by Aragon developers in future client releases.


#### *Open Source/For Profit Disclosure*
 *All code pertaining to this proposal and 'Etherize.It' more broadly will be open source. All Aragon functions will be made available at gas cost on Etherize.It in perpetuity. Additional functionalities, such as LLC incorporation and fiat to gas conversion, will likely be subject to additional charges.*

 *By the project's completion, as much functionality as possible will be made  available irrespective of platform. E.g., supplying the user with Ethereum bytecode so that they may notarize a document without relying upon Etherize.It/MetaMask, or to declare their DAO's linkage to an LLC, even if that DAO is not created using Aragon.*

#### *Other Disclosures*

*Personal Liability: Although designating a DAO or DAO tokenholders as owners of an LLC is believed by the authors of this proposal to shield participants from personal liability, this remains uncertain until legal precedents are set.*

*Financial Services: Streamlined DAO access to banking services is dependent upon the state-chartered bank legislation being passed. Fully pseudonymous access to US banking services remains unlikely.*
