## Proposal

The goal of this proposal is to provide a ready-to-use DAICO / continuous funding application. This application will respect the `Apiary` funding scheme defined by @lkngtn and described [here](https://github.com/1Hive/Apiary).

This work will also entail a research process around the current DAICO / continuous funding spectrum. This research will aim to identify the most common building-block shared by the actual DAICO / continuous funding landscape.

Our proposal is thus: a. to implement some of these building-blocks as a set of semi-independent components / libraires and ; b. to develop the `Apiary` application on top of these modular building-blocks.

We expect that this architecture will incentive other teams to re-use our building-blocks in order to implement - and experiment with - their own DAICO / continuous funding scheme if the provided `Apiary` app does not suit their need.
