# EmpowerTheDAO Team

### Chris Hobcroft and Will Griffiths — The Partnership

Chris and Will met at devcon4 in Prague in 2018, at the end of Virgil Griffith's presentation on Ethereum's "Special Projects".

As well as the [Livepeer Aragon App](https://github.com/videoDAC/livepeer-aragon/blob/master/README.md), they are currently working together on [LPT Futures](https://forum.livepeer.org/t/transcoder-campaign-lpt-futures/709) - a project to build tools to sell Livepeer Tokens (LPT) which are bonded to Livepeer's network.

They are both experienced Vipassana meditators, and occasionally meditate together before meetings.

Chris and Will are equal holders of voting weight in the [EmpowerTheDAO Aragon DAO](https://mainnet.aragon.org/#/empowerthedao.aragonid.eth).

### Chris Hobcroft — Project Lead

Chris was the co-creator of the [Livepeer Aragon App](https://github.com/videoDAC/livepeer-aragon/blob/master/README.md) (along with Will, see below), which empowers any Aragon DAO to delegate stake to Livepeer's Delegated-Proof-of-Stake Protocol, and also govern the operations of a Transcoder Node in Livepeer's Network.

He has 15 years experience working in technology innovation, including 2 years working on Ethereum-based projects. As a part of the team which launched Livepeer to mainnet, he created Livepeer TV - the first dApp running on Livepeer, empowered other Ethereum-based projects to livestream their events, and has done extensive user testing of Livepeer's protocol.

He has experience in Concept Definition, Business Operations, Project Management and Systems Analysis in "traditional" technology startups and consultancies, and has Computer Science and Mathematics degrees from Cambridge University.

Chris also enjoys cooking, singing with his ukulele, transacting on Ethereum, and riding motorbikes in India. He currently lives in London with his girlfriend, Petra.
