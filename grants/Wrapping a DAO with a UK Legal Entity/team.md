# Nexus Team

### Hugh Karp — Project Lead

An actuary by profession, having spent 15 years in the insurance industry. Began his career in Australia and worked for 10 years for a major life insurance company, MLC. Relocated to London, UK 5 years ago to work with Munich Re and was most recently the CFO for Munich Re’s UK life operations.

Has been intrigued by blockchain technology since 2011, when he discovered Bitcoin and played around with it for a while. Hugh was fascinated but couldn’t work out how to could contribute more meaningfully, so he put it aside until Ethereum and smart contracts came along. This sparked his interest again as he realised he could now apply his deep industry knowledge to his passion for decentralised technology. This spurred him to spend much of his spare time building the concepts around Nexus Mutual and to ultimately leave the corporate world in a bid to make it a reality.
