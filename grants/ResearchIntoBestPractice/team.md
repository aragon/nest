Iain Barclay
------------
Iain is an experienced software engineer and product manager, based in the UK. After leaving university and spending his early developer career with Hitachi and Hewlett-Packard Labs, Iain left and started a mobile software development company in 1998 - the pioneering days of the Palm Pilot! Iainâ€™s company went from strength to strength, developing apps for personal users as well as infrastructure for the device OEMs. In 2016, Iain decided it was time for a change and returned to University as a full-time mature student - gaining an MSc at distinction level in Information Security and Privacy. The study period and dissertation, which was in the blockchain space, got him interested in how blockchain can be used to assist in the formation and efficient running of distributed or decentralised groups, particularly those which form on the ground during emergency situations. Iain will return to University in April 2018 to conduct a research project into using blockchain to support these organisations, a project which will include further study into the behaviours of the groups and a software implementation intended to show how they can be supported in adopting best practice.
