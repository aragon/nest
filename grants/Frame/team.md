### C. Jordan Muir â€” Project Lead

Jordan is the creator of [Frame](https://github.com/floating/frame) and many other projects, most recently [Restore](https://github.com/floating/restore), a predictable and observable state container for React apps. Jordan is also the creator of the [NodeUp](https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/nodeup/id447667314) podcast, one of the most popular podcasts in the Node community; a community Jordan has been apart of almost as long as it's been around.

Jordan has extensive full stack experience (including design) with a focus on real-time apps and architectures. He won NodeKnockout as a single-person team with his project, HashPay. He loves discovering and using new technologies and protocols to solve problems and create impactful experiences that unlock value for users and humanity. That drive to innovate is what brought him to Ethereum and why he's excited about the potential it has. He hopes to be able to contribute to the ecosystem in meaningful ways that increase the use and adoption of Ethereum.
