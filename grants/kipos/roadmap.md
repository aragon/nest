# Kipos Roadmap
- **Fully deploying Aragon on [nou.network](https://nou.network/)**. 
nou.network is a small PoA for social projects with nodes from UPC, UAB, UOC, UdG, UIB, URV university teachers, GuifiNet and members the White Hat Group, that at this moment is also developing a project on a complementary social coin for the Sants neighbourhood in Barcelona. This also includes the required infrastructure (like ENS or aragonPM) and a basic translation to catalan and spanish of some modules. 

- **Writing a research paper** in english with the key findings on using Aragon and decentralized technologies, in housing projects, probably including: pains/gains, usage scenarios, conceptual approaches for mass adoption, next steps, and (we hope) a first real usage analysis. 
History and memorandum of all kipos meeting with Barcelona housing organizations. A detailed feedback from the Aragon dApp ecosystem teams.
Support the work done with a website or wiki promoting Aragon software for empowering housing communities in Catalan and Spanish.

- **Developing a specific AragonApp to manage shared resources** based on the research paper on housing projects problematic created.
