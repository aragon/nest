## **Etheric Bridge: Wyoming <=> Aragon**
### **ROADMAP v1.33**

The ground has already been cleared for a bridge between the 'real' world of nation states and the 'virtual' world of Ethereum. Blockchain entities (DAOs) may now control legal entities (LLCs) in the State of Wyoming's jurisdiction by signing statements with their key. As non-US citizens may be owners of Wyoming LLCs, we are faced with an unprecendented opportunity to drive  mass adoption with a historic bridge between DAOs and LLCs. 

This roadmap is part of a proposal for Aragon, a platform for the creation of Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs). This bridge facillitates interaction between Wyoming and Aragon. The tools proposed make use of the former's groundbreaking legislation and the latter's technology, built on Ethereum. The full proposal may be read [here](https://github.com/aragon/nest/pull/62).

#### Milestones:

### 1. Personal Use (LLC DAO Kit v0.1)
###### *Q1 '19 - $8k*

This kit allows Aragon DAOs to 'own' LLCs or Series LLCs, in full compliance with Wyoming legislation. This initial product is designed for the most simple use case: a personal LLC, owned by an Aragon DAO.

* Basic 'operating agreement' generation for incorporating a new LLC
* For those already owning an LLC, amendments are generated to grant ownership to the DAO
* A guide on linking one's LLC and DAO in compliance with Wyoming law (allowing savvy users to go beyond 'personal' use)


### 2. Constitution Generator (dApp)
###### *Q1 '19 - $12k*

A standalone service for generating **operating agreements** (human readable constitutions). Initially intended for the Wyoming/LLC use case, but designed to be extensible for other jurisdictions and entity types. 

* Allows anyone to create a PDF for an operating agreement
* Hash of the constitution may be stashed on Ethereum (or full text on IPFS or equivalent)
* Owners of Wyoming entities may be human (Name, Address) or virtual (Email, Public Key)
* Developed in consultation with a Wyoming accredited corporate lawyer

### 3. Notary (dApp)
###### *Q2 '19 - $12k*

An app for declaring records on public ledgers, such as Ethereum and Wyoming's mandated public record system*. This system will reduce the need for registered agents and clerks, by allowing keyholders to make statements to distributed ledgers. Each entry may be signed by a key, allowing DAOs to declare a linkage to a legal entity, engage in busines contracts with legal entities, modify its operating agreement, and so on.   *A hash of the document is stored on-chain, with option to store a copy of the full document on IPFS or some equivalent.*

*A partnership with the State of Wyoming may provide a 'notary reader', allowing users to examine all of the declarations made by a particular Ethereum address. *

### 4. Complex Organizations (LLC DAO Kit v1.0) 
###### *Q2 '19 - 14k*

Updates to the LLC DAO kit to facillitate complex DAO <=> LLC interactions. *E.g. transferring ownership of an LLC from one DAO to another DAO, or creating an LLC co-owned by two DAOs.*

* Integrate the Notary and Constitution dApps into Aragon's flow 
* Allows users to create and manage Series LLCs, which are capable of generating thousands of child LLCs
* Changes to a DAO's LLC(s) are easily issued from the Aragon interface
* A guide on accessing financial services using one's LLC DAO

*Sprout will be seeking partnership with the State of Wyoming to develop an interface for easily reading all of the Notary statements. This would be exeptionally helpful for clerks, judges, and accountants deciphering the statements issued by a DAO/blockchain address. Prospective legislation mandates the Secretary of State to make their API publicly accessibly by 2020.
