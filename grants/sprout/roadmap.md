###  *- DAOsprout Presents - *
# **Etheric Bridge: Aragon <=> Wyoming**
## **ROADMAP**

#### *Abridged Version*

### 0. Foundation

The ground has already been cleared by [legislation](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dLkHGE-h_5Cpfy0Lq2DxLahBwKkqeyOp8pUTDrsSCNg/edit?usp=sharing). Foundations for the world's first etheric bridge are constructed. A **Memo of Understanding** is the anchor; signed by the key players on both sides of the bridge. **Blueprints** are drafted, and a **Short Paper** is published explaining the utility of this bridge for Wyomingites and Aragonians alike. 


### 1. Rope Bridge

A precarious yet traversable bridge is built, allowing adventurers to cross the divide between the 'real' and the 'virtual' worlds. DAOsprout publicly creates the **first hybrid DAO/series LLC**, and grants **child LLCs to Aragonian applicants**. The e-mails gathered from this press push are sent an **instructional guide** for creating linked entities, and a **website** for generating **operating agreements** (constitutions) and **linkages** (Ethereum code) is published (extending [Etherize.It](https://devpost.com/software/etherize-it-daosprout)). Aragon DAOs are able to act as a Wyoming LLC's **owner** after amending the LLC's **operating agreement** & executing a **linkage statement** via Ethereum. 

### 2. Light Bridge

As the bridge widens, **entity creation and management functionality** is incorporated into **Aragon's UI**. Aragonians are able to easily **register a new LLC** (or Series LLC) in Wyoming, or **link their DAO to an existing legal entity** in any jurisdiction. Basic entity management options are available, such as **making amendments** to the entity's constitution and **creating child-LLCs**. Access to **U.S. bank accounts** is streamlined.


### 3. Trans-Dimensional Gateway [Optional Partnerships]

Portals to other systems begin to open, enhancing the network effect. This optional milestone is a commitment by Aragon to match resources with other projects with aligned goals. These **partnerships** will be **developed by DAOsprout** before being submitted to **Aragon's leadership for confirmation**.

Potential partners include the **State of Wyoming, WINGS, Consensys, Kleros,** and ** Status**, and will  focus on increasing **accountability** and **accessibility**.

#### *Extended Version*


### 0. Foundation
###### * Q4 '18 - $7k *

##### A) Jurisdictional Bridge: Memorandum of Understanding

*Although [HB0101](http://www.wyoleg.gov/2018/Introduced/HB0101.pdf) already permits blockchain addresses to manage legal entities, we believe that this memo can help build understanding and consensus for this difficult subject. The memo would define key terms for the state clerks, banks, and accountants, making it more clear what a DAO is and how DAOs, governments, and corporations can be connected and work together. *

*It will be signed by the Wyoming Blockchain Legislative Task Force, the Wyoming Blockchain Coalition, and Wyoming officials such as the Legislative Services Office, Secretary of State, Governor, State Legislators. *
      
##### B) Bridge Blueprints

*Functional Requirements, Mockups, Class Diagram for Milestones 1 & 2*

##### C) Short Paper

*An 3-6 page brief intended for easy public consumption. Intended especially for Aragonians and Wyomingites; explains jurisdictions, the Bridge, and the Utility of* ** DAO/LLCs hybrids**.


### 1. Rope Bridge

###### * Q1 '19 - $12k *

##### A) DAOsprout Becomes First Hybrid DAO/LLC

There are multiple reasons for this 'dogfooding'. First, to establish precedent and inform the bureaucrats we meet along the way that there will be more following us. Secondly, to develop a detailed instructional guide for those following us. Thirdly, we will popularize this effort and collect e-mail addresses from people who are interested. Lastly, DAOsprout will provide sub-LLCs and other services to other DAOs to the best of its ability, before Wyoming's jurisdiction is made more easily accessible to other DAOs. Quick and dirty; and we realize that reliance on middlemen is only a temporary solution. 

##### B) Instructional Guide on Building DAO/LLC Entities

E-mails collected in the step above will be sent an instructional guide on bridging LLCs and DAOs, and will be kept informed of future developments.
     
##### C) Constitution & Linkage Code Generator 

This is a standalone website with Aragon's UI package & branding. 
It is used for generating operating agreements for LLCs and Series LLCs, based on a template written by an [expert consultant](ballounlaw.com). Options for DAO ownership/partnership will be included. Existing LLC's can be provided an amendment to provide the same functionality. Lastly, a piece of code will be provided to be executed by the Ether wallet/DAO that claims ownership/partnership, to confirm the linkage on the public ledger.

##### D)  Confirm DAO <-> LLC Linkage via Aragon

Instructions will be provided for Aragon DAO owners to take advantage of the above services, but users may need to copy and paste the linkage code to execute it from Aragon's UI. 

### 2. Light Bridge
###### * Q2 '19 - $16k *
*The following functionalities will be made available from Aragon's user interface:*

##### A) Generate LLC & DAO Constitutions 

*Create PDFs for constitutions; store the hash on chain.*


##### B) Register new LLCs/Series LLCs in Wyoming

*Using the constitutions generated in part A.*


##### C) Link Existing Legal Entities to DAO 

   *Although any jurisdiction will be supported, the legality of DAO ownership may be contested in non-Wyoming jurisdictions*

##### D) Manage Linkages & Wyoming Entities
   
*For example, disavow a previous linkage; transfer LLC ownership to another DAO; create a child LLC with owner at Ethereum address X.*

##### E) Streamlined Bank Access
   
*At the very least, an instructional guide on how to open a US bank account with a Wyoming LLC. Ideally, a partnership with the planned Wyoming State Chartered Bank (currently being developed to provide finanial resoures to blokchain startups) will allow access to US bank account from Aragon's interface.*


### 3. Trans-Dimensional Gateways [Optional Partnerships]
###### * 2019 - $15k ETH + $10k ANT (total; likely sub-divided between projects) *

We have already had a number of organizations excited to partner with us on this project, but we want to maintain Aragon as the primary priority. Thus, this final milestone is more of a 'reserve' to be held to build partnerships with other agencies. DAOsprout will develop possible partnerships, pitch them to Aragon, and then execute them after both sides have committed to a proposal.

Some possibilities worth exploring:

##### A) Compliant Token Issuance ([WINGS](www.wings.ai)) 

*An Aragon DAO is able to vote on whether to issue tokens via the WINGS platform; providing it with an audience and expert evaluation. Compliance with security laws would be a focus.*

##### B) uPort Identity Integration ([Consensys](https://consensys.net/about/))
*Wyoming is eager to open up its API so that anyone can manage their entities from the comfort of Web 3.0, but some means of protection is necessary to stop bad actors from abusing the system. uPort may be used to create 'rings of trust' that users can earn and then gain access to increased functionality (e.g., not having to go through a registered agent to manage one's entity). FOR EXAMPLE: First level could be from ratifying the Jurisdictional Bridge Memorandum of Understanding; second could be gaining an attestation from a Registered Agent, and the third could be an attestation from a Wyoming clerk.  DAOsprout won the Consensys prize at the WyoHackathon. *
   
##### C) Dispute Resolution / White & Black Lists ([Kleros](www.kleros.io)) 
*Dispute resolution is a vital component of a jurisdiction's well-being. Kleros has already had an impressive mainnet test; using its staked dispute resolution system to create a 'white list' of [Doge memes](https://dogesontrial.dog). This platform could be used to create a collection of Etheric bridge memes to popularize this service, or could be used to create a blacklist of bad actors barred from Aragon and Wyoming's jurisdictions.*

##### D) Jurisdictional Self-Regulation (State of Wyoming)
*We have an opportunity to set a historical precedent in which regulators turn towards open, transparent systems for identifying and punishing bad actors; using reputation rather than violence for enforcement. This might take the form of a token-curated registry, or be more like Kleros's [Doges on Trial](https://dogesontrial.dog). *
