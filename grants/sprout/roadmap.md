###  - DAOsprout Presents -
# **Etheric Bridge: Aragon <=> Wyoming**
## **ROADMAP v1.2**

#### *Short Version (Extended Version Below)*

### 0. Foundation

The ground has already been cleared by [legislation](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dLkHGE-h_5Cpfy0Lq2DxLahBwKkqeyOp8pUTDrsSCNg/edit?usp=sharing). Foundations for the world's first etheric bridge are constructed. 
* A **Memo of Understanding** is the anchor; signed by the key players on both sides of the bridge
* **Blueprints** (tech specs) are drafted 
* **Short Paper** is published explaining the utility of this bridge for Wyomingites and Aragonians
* DAOsprout publicly creates the **first hybrid DAO/LLC** and publishes an **instructional guide** for others seeking to do the same


### 1. Rope Bridge

A difficult yet traversable bridge is built, allowing adventurous organizations to span the divide between the 'real' and the 'virtual' worlds. Two Aragon modules allow anyone to:

* Generate **operating agreements** (human readable constitutions) for LLCs/Series LLCs, that, if registered in Wyoming, may be legally controlled by a DAO
* Generate **linkage declarations** (Ethereum code), that, if executed by a wallet/DAO, signify a relationship to a legal entity in any jurisdiction


### 2. Etheric Bridge

As the bridge widens, **creation and management of entities and linkages** is incorporated into **Aragon's platform:** 
* Aragonians can easily **register a new LLC** (or Series LLC) in Wyoming, or **link their DAO to an existing legal entity** in any jurisdiction
* DAO owners are able to manage their linked legal entities (update operating agreement, change owner, etc)
* Access to US banking services is streamlined



### 3. Trans-Dimensional Gateway [Optional Partnerships]

Portals to other systems begin to open, enhancing the network effect. This optional milestone is a commitment by Aragon to match resources with projects with aligned goals. 
* Partnerships will be **developed by DAOsprout** before being submitted to **Aragon's leadership for confirmation**.
* Potential partners include the **State of Wyoming, WINGS, Consensys, Kleros,** and **Status**, and will focus on increasing **accountability** and **accessibility**.

### 0. Foundation
###### *Q4 '18 - $9k*

##### A) Jurisdictional Bridge: Memorandum of Understanding

Although [HB0101](http://www.wyoleg.gov/2018/Introduced/HB0101.pdf) already permits blockchain addresses to manage legal entities, we believe that this memo can help build understanding for this difficult subject, as well as deter federal regulators. The memo would define key terms for the state clerks, banks, and accountants, making it more clear what a DAO is and how DAOs, governments, and corporations can be connected and work together. 

*The memo will be signed by the Wyoming Blockchain Legislative Task Force, the Wyoming Blockchain Coalition, and Wyoming officials such as the Legislative Services Office, Secretary of State, Governor, State Legislators.*
      
##### B) Bridge Blueprints

Functional Requirements, Mockups, Class Diagram for Milestones 1 & 2

##### C) Short Paper

An 3-6 page brief intended for easy public consumption. Intended especially for Aragonians and Wyomingites; explains jurisdictions, the Bridge, and the utility of **DAO/LLCs hybrids**.

##### D) DAOsprout Becomes a Hybrid DAO/LLC

There are multiple reasons for this 'dogfooding'. 
* To inform the bureaucrats we meet along the way that there will be more following us
* To develop a detailed instructional guide for those seeking to make their own DAO/LLC
* We will popularize this effort and collect e-mail addresses from people who are interested
* Potentially: As a Series LLC, DAOsprout could provide sub-LLCs and other services to other DAOs, before Wyoming's jurisdiction is made more easily accessible to other DAOs. *Quick and dirty; we realize that reliance on middlemen is only a temporary solution.*

##### E) Instructional Guide on Building DAO/LLC Hybrids

E-mails collected in the press release surrouding the step above will be sent an instructional guide on bridging LLCs and DAOs, and will be kept informed of future developments.
     
### 1. Rope Bridge

###### *Q1 '19 - $12k*

     
##### A) Constitution Generator 

This is a module for Aragon for generating operating agreements for LLCs and Series LLCs, based on a template written by an [expert consultant](ballounlaw.com). Options for DAO ownership/partnership will be included. If the LLC already exists, amendments are provided to give ownership to a DAO/Ether address. 

##### B)  Linkage Generator

A second module for Aragon that allows a DAO to declare a linkage between itself and a legal entity, on the Ethereum blockchain. Anyone can view the linkages declared by a particular ETH address. 

### 2. Etheric Bridge
###### *Q2 '19 - $14k*
*The modules described above will be extended:*

##### A) Manage Entity
Functions Include: Change operating agreement, change owners, dissolve entity, and for series LLCs: create a child LLC with owner at Ethereum address X

##### B) Manage Linkages
   
Functions include: revoke a previous linkage; transfer LLC ownership to another DAO, etc 

##### C) Bank Access
   
At the very least, an instructional guide on how to open a US bank account with a Wyoming LLC. Ideally, the planned Wyoming State Chartered Bank will allow access to US banking services from an additional Aragon module

### 3. Trans-Dimensional Gateways [Optional Partnerships]
###### *2019 - $15k ETH + $10k ANT (total; likely sub-divided between projects)*

We have already had a number of organizations excited to partner with us on this project, but we want to maintain Aragon as the primary priority. Thus, this final milestone is more of a 'reserve' to be held to build partnerships with other agencies. DAOsprout will develop these possible partnerships, pitch them to Aragon, and then execute them after both sides have committed to the proposal.

Some possibilities worth exploring:

##### A) Compliant Token Issuance ([WINGS](www.wings.ai)) 

An Aragon DAO is able to vote on whether to issue tokens via the WINGS platform; providing it with an audience and expert evaluation. Compliance with US security laws would be a focus.

##### B) uPort Identity Integration ([Consensys](https://consensys.net/about/))
Wyoming is eager to open up its API so that anyone can manage their entities from the comfort of Web 3.0, but some means of protection is necessary to stop bad actors from abusing the system. uPort may be used to create 'rings of trust' that users can earn and then gain access to increased functionality (e.g., not having to go through a registered agent to manage one's entity). *FOR EXAMPLE: First level could be from ratifying the Jurisdictional Bridge Memorandum of Understanding; second could be gaining an attestation from a Registered Agent, and the third could be an attestation from a Wyoming clerk.  DAOsprout won the Consensys prize at the WyoHackathon.*
   
##### C) Dispute Resolution / White & Black Lists ([Kleros](www.kleros.io)) 
Dispute resolution is a vital component of a jurisdiction's well-being. Kleros has already had an impressive mainnet test; using its staked dispute resolution system to create a 'whitelist' of [Doge memes](https://dogesontrial.dog). This platform could be used to create a blacklist of bad actors barred from Aragon and Wyoming's jurisdictions.

##### D) Jurisdictional Self-Regulation (State of Wyoming)
*We have an opportunity to set a historical precedent in which regulators turn towards open, transparent systems for identifying and punishing bad actors; using reputation rather than violence for enforcement. This might take the form of a token-curated registry, or be more like Kleros's [Doges on Trial](https://dogesontrial.dog).*
