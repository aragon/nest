The development timeline will be the following one in regards to each deliverable:

1. Feb 2018 - Production ready DAPP & Deployment
2. March-April 2018 - Production ready DAO contracts
3. Q2 2018 - DAO / Token Launch
4. Beyond - More DAPPs to generate income - use cases listed at end of whitepaper.
4. Beyond/Moon - DAO based on ERC-721 voting steered by philanthropists instead of token holders

## Deliverables

1. A DAPP to tokenize donations. This DAPP creates charity campaigns, issues tokens for each campaign representing specific donations. The DAPP issues a Tax Certificate for tax refunds with the organizations 501c Id. 

[Working Prototype is available: [https://igave.io/demo](https://igave.io/demo)]

2. An Embedded Donation button. This button interacts directly with the DAPP smart contract to purchase donation tokens. This allows anyone to include a single js file and decorate HTML elements to web3 enable them to accept donations for a cause. 

[Working Prototype is available: [https://igave.io/embedded/1/3](https://igave.io/embedded/1/3)]

3. An ICO/DAO to issue a new currency, abscond and lock the ICO funds and Dev Funds in a trust, and a monthly voting schedule to disburse funds to a verified, chosen non-profits. The amount of unlocked dev funds at launch diminish as the ICO funds increase
[Planning Stage. We are still finalizing the best steps forward here]
