## Follow-up questions and answers

**1) The tool that you guys are going to be working on is a website for the aggregation of the different signals, right? You are not going to be working on the specific signals? What we are trying to see here is the exact scope of work that justifies the burn rate per month ($30k per 3 months)**

The outcome of the project will indeed be a website that aggregates different signals. These signals will be obtained through connections to 3rd party projects and apps. However, given the nature of this project, we do see our work as including a heavy amount of research, UX design, maintenance, partnerships and community management. 

We have decided to separate the initial UX user research from the monthly burn - as this is a one time effort. We identify the stand alone budget for the UX user research to be 10K. Please see question 2 for more about this work, and why we believe it is necessary for a project like this. 

We have decided to spread the remaining budget over 4 months (instead of the original 3) and make this a $20K burn rate. It will be broken down in the following way: 

- Full Time PM: $7800 
- Development: $9500
  - Part Time Developers 
  - Bounties
  - Reward DAO
- Community management: $1000
- Travel and communication: $500
- Admin & misc: $1200


*Calculation: $20k Burn Rate x 4 months = $80 K total + $10 K initial UX research = $90K for 4 month period of the grant.* 



**2) The research of the project you refer to is the series of interviews you will be doing to different stakeholders of the community, right?**

In order to ensure that this project is a success, the requirements of some of the core stakeholders will need to be carefully understood. We believe the UX of the site is important and needs to be developed thoughtfully.  

In order to do this, we have decided the best approach to this is to start with in-depth interviews of a sample of these stakeholders. This will not only help us to build a signaling site that is useful, but will help to include these contributors early on in the creation of the project. 

These in-depth interviews (each ranging from 15 mins to 1 hour), as well as the additional community feedback we will be gathering, will be shared with the larger community - in the form of videos, articles and documentation -  to ensure transparency into our thinking and process. This will also hopefully prompt continued dialogue around how information is shared within the space. 

Additional research is required around signal implementation. 
This includes finding additional signals, projects and potential partners, as well as establishing what development is needed to effectively include Miner and Node signaling. 

**3) We are not going to have the 5 signals included in the website at the end of the project. Only 3 of them? I imagine this is because some of them are still under development.**

The first 3 signals we will be adding are already implementable without any additional work on the actual signals - there are already teams that have built or are building these signals and they are ready to be included. However, the last 2 signals are more complicated and may require an EIP in order to build them. 

Through our research, we will evaluate the importance of the remaining signals, compare them to new signals types that we discover, identify the necessary work for and then determine the timeframe for their implementation. We commit to having any necessary EIPs written by the end of this project, however the implementation timeline of EIPs is ultimately a decision of the core devs and we decided to respect this in the proposal.


**4) You say you will be using existing tools and platforms for this project. Can you give us some examples?**

- Gas Voting
  -Slockit.io 
- Coin Voting
  -https://www.etherchain.org/coinvote
- Influencer Stances
  -Cryptoinfluencers.io


**5) Regarding the Ethereum influencers list, I understand the list is 100% algorithmically generated, is this algorithm open?**

Regarding the influencer list, we are currently testing and doing research on the viability of something like cryptoinfluencers.io in order for us to determine if a system like this is appropriate for our project.  

The algorithm development will be the responsibility of the cryptoinfluencers.io group (or whichever partner that we may work with). The cryptoinfluencers.io group have stated in our Riot channes that they will indeed be opening this up. 

According to them “... our goal is to open-source our algorithm and decentralize its governance. We just believe that starting in a centralized model and decentralizing once we prove that it can work increases chances of success.”


**6) Regarding the EIPs explorer, can you describe a bit more in detail what are we going to see here, how detailed is this going to be?**

We would like for any EIP to be available for signalling. This will require a rich filtering system. Filtering by Status and Category, as well as search by Number and Title will be included. We would like this to be as detailed as is useful.

We are opening our design documents to the public at the following locations.

**7) Is somehow a bit difficult to match the deliverable mention here and the ones mentioned in the roadmap can you unify them so we have one list of deliverables?**

*There was a small discrepancy here between roadmap and deliverables - we have corrected this in the proposal.*

We have also updated our budget calculations and added financial projections.
