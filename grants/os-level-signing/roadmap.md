# Development Timeline

_subject to change as the design and architecture evolve
during the proposal formulation (prior to submission & acceptance)_

### Phases:

1. __Alpha implementation__
    1. Prototype to testnet
        1. Signing functionality
        1. DApp integration (browser & non-browser based)
        1. Wallet integration (?)
    1. Test-suite
    1. os-level-signer developer documentation
    1. Demo / example using application
1. __Beta implementation__
    1. Application
        1. Wallet integration (?)
        1. Full suite of platform implementations
    1. Documentation for building apps with os-level-signer
    1. Code audits and other security
    1. User testing / feedback
    1. End-to-end CI
    1. (flex-room for the unpredictable)
1. __Release Candidate implementation__
    1. Finalize interfaces / APIs
    1. Website / download location
    1. End-user documentation
    1. More security related activities
    1. (flex-room for the unpredictable)
1. __First Release and Beyond!__
    1. Bugfixes and Documentation updates
    1. More wallets / enhancements
    1. Spread the good word

### Schedule:

Estimated total time: __3-4 Quarters__

I expect Phases 1 & 2 to occupy about 2 Quarters (with `1 < 2`),
with some first end-to-end prototypes within a month.

Milestones:

- Prototype on testnet
- All OS versions
- Interface / API stabilization
- Full implementation with demos
- Wallet (SW/HW) integration
- Integratable f
- Consumable by users

_milestone ordering has some flexibility_
