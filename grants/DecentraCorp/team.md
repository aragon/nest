# DecentraCorp

### Christopher Dixon â€” Project Lead

I am the founder of DecentraCorp, the inventor of the CryptoPatent Blockchain and the ChaosCasino. I had the Idea for DecentraCorp and the CryptoPatent Blockchain at the End of October 2017. In the last year I have done side work in everything from car and phone repair to plumbing and electrical work. In between being a full time parent while my fiance is at work and my side work I've spent the last year learning the programming tools necessary to build DecentraCorp to where it is today(Solidity, React, and Python). During this last year I also worked as the Lead Solidity Developer on a CryptoCurrency Marketplace known as Forra.io. After helping them complete their MVP in August I began working full time on DecentraCorp (Which up until this point I had been working on part time).

Over this last Year I have dedicated my life to building DecentraCorp and learning all that I have because I truly believe DecentraCorp has the potential to fundamentally change the way the world works!
