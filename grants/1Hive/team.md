### burrrata

Full stack developer with experience programming in Python, Tensorflow, Rust, Javascript, React, and more. Passionate about tools and systems that allow people to do what they want, when they want, with who they want, whenever they want. As a result I've been involved in the Ethereum ecosystem for many years and recently have been focused on DAOs, esp Aragon. I've contributed to the Aragon community via Daonuts, 1Hive, and the Aragon Cooperative.

I plan on contributing to the 1Hive Dandelion Orgs project by creating a website, documentation, and user guides to make the project accessible to developers. In addition I will also contribute to front-end development of apps and solidity code if time allows.

**Commitment**: Can range from 5-20 hours a week depending on what needs to be done.
