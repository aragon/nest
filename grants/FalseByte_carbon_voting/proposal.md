## Request for Funding

FalseByte Carbon Voting is a request for funding for completing the deliverables associated with Nest Proposal #7. 

At ETHDenver our team implemented what we believe is a solution to the requirements specified in the proposal. For more of a description see the README in the github linked above.

We have completed deliverable #1.  We would like to setup an initial solution review with the Aragon team.

Deliverable #2 is out of scope for the Truebit team, but we are able to organize this piece of the bounty with partners from Pragma after review with Aragon team.

Deliverable #3 is doable, and may be the last step before deploying onchain.  We would like to scope this deliverable further with the Aragon team.
