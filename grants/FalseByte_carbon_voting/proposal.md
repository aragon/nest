## Request for Funding

FalseByte Carbon Voting is a request for funding for completing the deliverables associated with Nest Proposal #7. 

At ETHDenver our team implemented what we believe is a solution to the requirements specified in the proposal. For more of a description see the README in the github linked above.

We believe that we have completed deliverable #1.

Deliverable #2 is out of scope for our team

Deliverable #3 is doable, and may be the last step before deploying onchain.
