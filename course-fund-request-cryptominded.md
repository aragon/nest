## Proposal

At Cryptominded our goal has been to educate beginners on cryptocurrencies from the start. As the platform & industry gained more traction, we've spoken to hundreds of beginning cryptocurrency investors online and offline at events that we've organised and have gotten a broad understanding of beginners' challenges, questions and motives.

We are confident that we're able to bring out a high-quality course to educate the beginning investors & users of cryptocurrency coming into the industry and support a sustainable growth of this market. Over the past months we've been answering many questions from beginners, have helped to fight phishing attacks and educate around security. This definitely has led to us being awfully aware of the need of education in this scene.

While the technology that supports cryptocurrencies is absolutely amazing and evolving with the day, we've seen over and over again that the UX has still a long way to go. Many people fail to understand the basics and end up making crucial mistakes due to this lack of understanding. However, we're of the belief this is mostly a sign that better education is required alongside an improving UX, after all when you give an old person access to internet banking, there's a very good chance that person will make crucial mistakes as well. 

Thereby we believe there will always be the lack of financial education among many, which paired with the quickly rising values of cryptocurrencies results into worrying decisions affecting their personal finance, this is something we would love to help prevent through proper education.

Educating newcomers is really important to us and at the core of why we're spending time on Cryptominded, and while we indeed acknowledge there will always be people that are not willing to put in the time to learn, we have also observed there's a lack of quality education material in this industry which is unbiased and/or freely accessible.

We’re planning to change this by bringing out a high-quality **14 module course on cryptocurrency investing, trading & usage**, addressing questions and concerns for newcomers and helping them to avoid the many pitfalls they have to navigate. In the course we’ll be addressing topics such as:

1. Getting beginners to understand what cryptocurrencies are and why they get so much attention at the moment.
2. Answer the question whether people should invest or not and and help them evaluate investment decisions. 
3. Help people figure out how to purchase, transact & safely store cryptocurrencies,
4. Protect users from common mistakes & scams.
5. Helping beginners understand the differences between various currencies.
6. Answer the most commonly asked questions by beginners.
_A full outline of the course can be provided upon request_

We plan to rope in multiple perspectives and have already lined up multiple interviews with experts in the cryptocurrency, financial history & personal finance industries.

We’re applying for a grant because we would like to put out a high-quality course, one that you’d be comfortable referring your own mom to in case she wants to learn more, without requiring to charge for the course or have biased opinions due to underlying motives.

Producing a high-quality course requires proper copywriting and editing to make the course well designed and the information easily understood. We expect to make videos studio quality, and expect additional costs to travel to meet & interview experts on the topics of cryptocurrencies and personal finance.

We want this course to be about common sense, not 'get rich quick' type of content. It will give a solid educational foundation for people that want to get into cryptocurrencies to either invest in it or use them in some other way - say, using it as a currency.

**Course outline:**
The course overview can be found here, and we'd be very happy and open to receive feedback on it:

We're more than happy to work with the Aragon community to ensure the quality of the course, such as making sure the content is factually correct, unbiased/balanced, easy to understand for those not as technically inclined as most of the aragon community and ensure we go in-depth and address all perspectives.

## What we will deliver

1. A (forever) **free to consume**, but high-quality, beginners course existing of 14 modules containing multiple lessons both theoretical and practical with the aim to address all the important topics and questions beginners may have.
2. A community forum where questions can be asked, lessons be discussed and where those with more expertise are ready to answer & clarify any questions by beginners.
3. A course on utilising Aragon as entrepreneur to build self-governing communities or run a distributed business.
4. 12 world-wide events to reach & educate beginners and promote the course.
5. A research platform where people can find factual data about all the various cryptocurrencies out there to make better investment decisions and avoid obvious vaporware and/or scams
