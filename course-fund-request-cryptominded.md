## Proposal

It’s evident that cryptocurrencies have steadily risen in popularity over the past year. Many retail investors have gotten into the space and it wouldn’t surprise us if even your grandparents have asked what this bitcoin thing is all about. Interest rates on saving accounts are at an all-time low after all, who doesn’t want to benefit a bit from the crypto-run.

While we obviously support this growth of this industry, we also recognize all it’s pitfalls. It’s a wild west out there with ponzi schemes, fraudulent coins & wallets, phishing attacks, vaporware projects, security issues and besides all of that, let’s be honest… cryptocurrencies are not a particularly friendly investment vehicle for people that are not tech savvy.

We feel it’s our duty to protect newcomers into this industry through educating them properly, while there will always be people that are not willing to put in the time, we’ve seen over and over again that there’s many that do want to learn more, but simply can’t find good educative sources to do so. The high-quality courses that are out there are usually aimed at the technical aspects of blockchain technology and those that have a financial perspective are usually biased in their advise or charge ridiculous fees for low-quality webcam videos. 

We’re planning to change this by bringing out a **14 module course on cryptocurrency investing, trading & usage**, addressing questions and concerns for newcomers and helping them to avoid the many pitfalls they have to navigate. In the course we’ll be addressing topics such as:

1. Getting beginners to understand what cryptocurrencies are and why they get so much attention at the moment.
2. Answer the question whether people should invest or not and what they should invest in + teach some common sense personal finance. 
3. Help people figure out how to purchase, transact & safely store cryptocurrencies
4. Protect users from common mistakes & scams
5. Helping beginners understand the differences between various currencies.
6. Answer the most commonly asked questions by beginners.
_A full outline of the course can be provided upon request_

The goal is to rope in multiple perspectives on the industry and give people a broad understanding of the market, cryptocurrencies as investment vehicle and some common sense personal finance basics.

We’re applying for a grant because we want to put out a high-quality course, one that you’d be comfortable referring your own mom to in case she wants to learn more, without requiring to charge for the course or have biased opinions through underlying motives.

Producing a high-quality course obviously goes paired with costs as it requires proper copywriting & editing to make the information easily understood, good design, high quality videos and additional costs to travel to meet & interview experts on the topics of cryptocurrencies and personal finance.

We want this course to be about common sense, no rich quick type of content, but give a solid educational foundation for people that want to get into cryptocurrencies to either invest in it or use them in some other way.

The course overview can be found here, it is possible to give feedback, please do if you have any:

We're more than happy to work with the Aragon community to ensure the quality of the course, such as making sure the content is factually correct, unbiased/balanced, easy to understand for those not as technically inclined as most of the aragon community and ensure we go in-depth and address all perspectives.

## What we will deliver

1. A **free to consume**, but high-quality, beginners course existing of 14 modules containing multiple lessons both theoretical and practical with the aim to address all the important topics and questions beginners may have.
2. A community forum where questions can be asked, lessons be discussed and where those with more expertise are ready to answer & clarify any questions by beginners.
3. A course on utilising Aragon as entrepreneur to build self-governing communities or run a distributed business.
4. 12 world-wide events to reach & educate beginners and promote the course.
5. A research platform where people can find factual data about all the various cryptocurrencies out there to make better investment decisions and avoid obvious vaporware and/or scams
