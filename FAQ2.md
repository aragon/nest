# Frequently Asked Questions

New version with the DAO of DAOs model.

<br>

## Overview

The Nest program exists to help teams innovate with governance at the speed of software and build unstoppable organizations.

We do this in 3 ways:
- **Ideation:** we will help you validate and refine your ideas. This includes feedback on initial proposals as well as help understanding the Aragon stack so that you can realize your dreams on the platform.
- **Funding:** we will provide you with capital to build out your ideas. This will be delivered in 3 phases: ⅓ up front to start work, ⅓ upon the delivery of a successful prototype, ⅓ upon shipment of a production ready product to mainnet.
- **Support Network:** shipping is hard. Once your prototype is working, we will help you get user feedback, security audits, and legal council so that you can ship a production ready application to end users. 

We are dedicated to helping humanity organize, coordinate, and collaborate at scale. Join us in fighting for freedom. Let’s buidl the future together.

## General

### How do I find more information about the Nest program?
- The GitHub repository is the main source of information about the program. There is some additional information on the [Aragon website](https://aragon.org/project/grants/).

### How much are the Nest Grants? 
- The minimum grant size is USD 5,000 and the maximum grant size is 150,000. In addition, grantees are able to apply for a success bonus of up to 50,000 ANT. The average size of an Aragon Nest grant is USD [insert] and [insert] ANT. 
If the amount of funding you are looking for is under USD 5,000, your project may be better suited to the Aragon [Community Fund DAO (CFDAO)](https://forum.aragon.org/t/how-to-make-proposals-to-the-community-funding-dao/697).

### Are Nest grants paid up front in a lump sum or distributed over milestones?
- 1/3 of your grant will be delivered when your grant is approved
- 1/3 of your grant will be delivered when you ship a prototype
- 1/3 of your grant will be delivered when you ship a production ready product

### What does Aragon get for supporting projects via the Nest program? Does it get tokens/equity from the grantees?
- It depends... We require all projects to open source their code and/or documentation. In addition:
    - If your project is building Aragon developer tooling, user facing applications, or 3rd party integrations that do not have a value capture mechanism (fees, project token, etc...) then we will fork the repo and release it for the Aragon ecosystem to maintain. If you are interested in maintaining your project after the grant we encourage that and will provide incentives for you to do so.
    - If your project is building an application that generates positive cash flows or captures value to a project specific token then we will request tokens and/or equity in your organization. This is handled on a case by case basis.

### Do you take board seats? 
- Not exactly... If your project is approved we will create a DAO specifically for that project. The AA will hold Super Voting tokens in that DAO that control all permissions. We will then deposit funds to your DAO as you reach certain milestones (project approval, prototype, shipped product). Funds in this DAO will be controlled by a multisig consisting of your Nest project lead, your team lead, and your Aragon community advisor. Salaries will be paid out on a monthly basis and require a 2/3 signature. In the case that the Nest project lead, Nest project team lead, or Aragon community advisor are not acting in the best interest of the Aragon community the AA reserves the right to off-board individuals and replace them as needed. To date no one has ever been off-boarded from their project DAO. 

### When is the right time to approach Aragon for a Nest grant? 
- We encourage projects and teams of all sizes and stages to [apply for Nest](https://github.com/aragon/nest/issues/new). This can include prototypes that are pre-launch to fully established organisations and projects that want to integrate with Aragon. The only exception is that Nest grants are not suitable for projects that are purely research related in nature. 

<br>

## Pre-Application

### How do I find out if my project could be eligible for a grant?
- Check the [Requests For Proposals](https://github.com/temp-nestdao/nest/blob/master/README.md#requests-for-proposals) section of the Nest program README.

### How do I submit a Nest grant application
- Applying for a Nest grant is as simple as opening a [new Issue](https://github.com/aragon/nest/issues/new) in this repo. 

### What if I’m working on something that has already applied to or been funded by the Nest program?
- If there is an existing proposal for a grant or funded project that is close to your idea, join in the discussion of that proposal to see if your proposal could be integrated into the existing one. If not, feel free to create a new proposal.

### My project is for-profit. Can I still apply? 
- Overall what matters is that projects deliver value to Aragon and ANT token holders. Projects must also be completely open source. If you feel that your project qualifies, please apply.

### My project will be used across other platforms in addition to Aragon. Can I still apply?
- We are looking for projects that deliver value to Aragon and ANT token holders. If you feel that your project qualifies, please apply.

### My project is not a typical Nest grant. It has to do with providing good or services to the Aragon ecosystem. Can I still apply?
- We are looking for projects that deliver value to Aragon and ANT token holders. If you feel that your project qualifies, please apply. If you have a project that does not fit into the framework provided, perhaps a service based proposal, we will work with you to create a custom funding roadmap. 

### Do you fund research?
- No. But the Aragon [Community Fund DAO (CFDAO)](https://forum.aragon.org/t/how-to-make-proposals-to-the-community-funding-dao/697) does. 

### Do you provide grants to single founders?
- While we prefer to fund teams, overall what matters is that projects deliver value to Aragon and ANT token holders. If you feel that your project qualifies, please apply.
 
### Do you provide grants to non-technical projects? 
- Absolutely. Most of the grants we make are technical in nature, we are equally excited to support non-technical projects that meet our grant requirements.

### What kinds of proposals are most likely to get funded?  
- The offical Nest program [Requests For Proposals](https://github.com/temp-nestdao/nest/blob/master/README.md#requests-for-proposals) outline the things we are the most excited about supporting. The Aragon community has also created an [Aragon Wishlist](https://forum.aragon.org/t/agp-wishlist-and-blacklist/355) that might serve as further inspiration. 

### Are there any other requirements to recieve funding besides just building our project?
- You will need to sign a legal agreement with the Aragon Association, use an Aragon DAO to transparently manage your funds, create a Keybase chat for your project, create a logo for your project (we can help with this), and create documentation for your project (we have templates for this), and (if your project handles private keys or has solidity code) get a security audit for your project (we can help with this).

## Application Process

### Submitting an application
- To submit an application to the Nest program open a [new Issue](https://github.com/aragon/nest/issues/new) in the Aragon Nest repo.

### Nest lead review
- A NestDAO team member will tag your proposal as "under reivew." They will then ask questions to better understand your goals. During this intial interview suggestions may be provided improvements to increase the success of your proposal. The GitHub Issue for your proposal is where the majority of conversations around your application should happen. 

### NestDAO lead approval
- Once questions have been answered and feedback has been incorporated, a NestDAO team member will “lead” your proposal. They will signal this by assigning the Issue to themselves in the nest GitHub repo. This NestDAO member is now your primary point of contact throughout the Nest program. It is their job to support, fight for, and ensure the success of your project in the Nest program. Your NestDAO lead will then schedule a call with you to better understand your goals and the mechanics of your project. They will then create a due diligence report based on the size of the grant you're requesting and they will then publish that report as a comment in your proposal Issue. Your Nest lead will then present your due diligence report along with your proposal to the NestDAO Working Group at the next NestDAO meeting. Your NestDAO lead will then explain why this proposal is a good fit for the Nest program, the value it will provide to Aragon, and why the Nest program should fund it.  

### NestDAO WG approval
- When proposals are presented at NestDAO WG meetings members can ask your Nest lead questions, request changes to your proposal, and/or reject or approve your proposal. The results of this discussion will be shared with you as a comment in your proposal's GitHub Issue by your Nest lead. For transparency and auditability this feedback needs to be delivered to the applicants as a comment in the original proposal Issue. This Issue is where the majority of conversations around the application should happen. 
- If you need to incorporate feedback or make changes, you will be able to do so. After relaying feedback to you, your Nest lead will follow up to ensure that you have everything you need to make the appropriate changes. Once you have done so, you can post a comment to let them know (using the @ feature on GitHub). Your Nest lead will then present your updated application to the NestDAO WG at the next meeting.
- If your project is approved, your Nest lead will tag your proposal Issue as `approved` and `in development`. Your Nest lead will then coordinate with you to provide the appropriate legal documents for you to formally receive the first 1/3 of your grant funding. This will involve creating a DAO specifically for your project. The AA will hold Super Voting tokens in that DAO that control all permissions. We will then deposit funds to your DAO as you reach certain milestones (project approval, prototype, shipped product). Funds in this DAO will be controlled by a multisig consisting of your Nest project lead, your team lead, and your Aragon community advisor. Salaries will be paid out on a monthly basis and require a 2/3 signature. In the case that the Nest project lead, Nest project team lead, or Aragon community advisor are not acting in the best interest of the Aragon community the AA reserves the right to off-board individuals and replace them as needed. To date no one has ever been off-boarded from their project DAO. 

### Prototype
Throughout the early development phase your Nest lead will be able to answer any questions you have and/or point you to someone in the Aragon community who can help. Once you have a prototype built your Nest lead will review the prototype and present it to the Nest WG at the next meeting.
- The NestWG may request changes to the prototype before it is ready to move on to the next stage. If so, your Nest lead will share this feedback in the Issue for your Nest project.
- If the NestWG feels this is satisfactory the next 1/3 of your grant funding will be provided to your project DAO. Your Nest lead will then tag your project Issue as `prototype complete`.

### Shipping
Once your prototype is approved you will be ready to polish your project for shippment. Your Nest lead will provide you with support getting user feedback from the Aragon community, getting legal council if your project manages funds, and getting a security audit if you have a solidity contract. Once you have received and incorporate feedback into your application your Nest lead will present the project to the NestWG. 
- The NestWG may request changes to the prototype before it is ready to move on to the next stage. If so, your Nest lead will share this feedback in the Issue for your Nest project.
- If the NestWG feels this is satisfactory the last 1/3 of your grant funding will be provided to your Nest DAO. Your Nest lead will then tag your project Issue as `project complete`.

### Ongoing Support
Congratulations! You've made it through the Aragon Nest program. We really appreciate your hard work :) 

Your Nest lead will reach out to ask questions about your experience and what your next steps are. We hope that you choose to continue building on Aragon. 
- If you have a few ideas you want to test out, but aren't quite ready to move forward with, the Nest program can provide you with a 5-10k stretch grant to help you experiment with more Aragon ideas.  
- Once you have an idea your Nest project lead will help you create and submit another Nest application. As a valued Aragon contributor any future proposals that you submit will receive expedited processing. We will turn around your grant within 7 business days to help you start building as fast as possible. It is our goal to do everything we can to make it as easy, fast, and fun to build on Aragon with us. 

<br>

### How long until I get feedback on my application?
- As a first time Nest program applicant you can expect a Nest team member to respond with questions, comments, and suggestions within 72 hours of your submission. 

### How long does the entire grant process to take. 
- As a first time Nest program applicant the process from application to approval takes about a 1 month.

### How will the funds be released to the grantees?
- All payments will be made in cryptocurrencies. The grants will be paid in DAI and released in portions according to the agreed roadmap (and deliverables) that the team has submitted in their proposal. A possible reward depending on total project completion will be given in ANT to reward value created for the Aragon Network and to enable the participation in the governance of the project.

### Do you have standard legal documents that you use between Aragon Association and the Nest team? 
- Yes, you will receive a standardised grantee agreement that you will be expected to sign. You can click here to [view a template of this legal agreement](nest-agreement.md).
