# Guide for submitting a [new Request for funding](https://github.com/aragon/nest/pulls)

- Check the [**Proposals for grants**](https://github.com/aragon/nest/issues) for existing proposals
- If you don’t find anything close to what you’re working on, [**submit a new proposal for a grant**](https://github.com/aragon/nest/issues/new) and **discuss** if we should consider it for a grant

Follow these steps:

- Fork the [Aragon Nest GitHub repository](https://github.com/aragon/nest)
- Create a new directory with **your project’s name** inside the `grants/` folder.
- Inside that, create two files, `team.md` and `roadmap.md`, where you present **your team** and **suggested roadmap**
- **Create a Pull Request** to merge your submission into the Nest repository. In that Pull Request, be sure to fill in **all the relevant info** described in the Pull Request Guide.md
- Engage the community and discuss! The community, and members of the [Aragon's teams](https://aragon.one) will review your submission and get back to you

## Pull Request example for submitting a request for funding
```
# Request for Nest membership and funding (#X)

**Team name**: AraEagles

**Proof of concept / research whitepaper**: https://github.com/example/cryptoeagles-erc721

**Burn rate**: $10k/month

**Legal structure**: NA / Aragon DAO

**[Team and roadmap](1/files)**



## Proposal

AraEagles is a proposal for the _Eagles on the blockchain_ call for projects, with the intent of implementing a fully ERC721-compliant AragonOS app that tokenizes eagles on the blockchain.

Our approach is novel since we want to implement AraEagles as a parachain by using Polkadot, therefore avoiding the clutter that eagles on the blockchain would produce on the Ethereum blockchain. Our research has shown that without doing our own parachain, we could potentially endanger the Ethereum network.

We are a driven team willing to take on this project and work on it for the next year.
