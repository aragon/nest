# Aragon Nest

![Aragon Nest Logo](https://wiki.aragon.org/design/artwork/Nest/01.png)

We believe the fate of humanity will be decided at the frontier of technological innovation. It is essential that this technology creates positive-sum value for all parties involved. In a globally connected world it is essential that people can connect, organize, share in value creation - anytime, anywhere, without borders or intermediaries. This is Aragon: technology that empowers people to create unstoppable organizations.

If you are interested in joining us on this mission, the Nest program will help you realize your dreams on the Aragon platform. We are interesting in supporting teams who want to build developer tooling, Aragon applications, and Aragon ecosystem services that enable the network to expand and flourish. To help you succeed we provide capital, mentorship, and professional support services. Our goal is to help you build your ideas and ship them to users on Aragon.
