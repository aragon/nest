## How to submit a proposal for a grant?

1. Make sure the [Proposals for grants](https://github.com/aragon/nest/issues) don’t have an existing proposal for something similar to your idea or project. If there is a proposal close to your idea or project, join the discussion of that Proposal to see if your idea or project could be integrated into the existing one, or if you should create a new proposal

2. If nothing similar exists, create [a new Proposal for grants](https://github.com/aragon/nest/issues/new) at the [Nest Repository](https://github.com/aragon/nest/), fill it out in detail following the [Guide for submitting a proposal for grants](https://wiki.aragon.one/nest/guides/guide_for_submitting_a_proposal_for_grants/) and **discuss** if we should consider it for a grant

3. After step 1 or 2, if you feel ready to apply for a grant see the [Guide for submitting a new request for funding](https://wiki.aragon.one/nest/guides/guide_for_submitting_a_request_for_funding/) and follow these steps:
    - Fork the [Aragon Nest GitHub repository](https://github.com/aragon/nest)
    - Create a new directory with **your project’s name** inside the `grants/` folder. 
    - Inside that, create two files, [`team.md`](https://wiki.aragon.one/nest/templates/team/) and [`roadmap.md`](https://wiki.aragon.one/nest/templates/roadmap/), where you present **your team** and **suggested roadmap**
    - **Create a Pull Request** to merge your submission into the Nest repository. In that Pull Request, be sure to fill in **all the relevant info** described in the [Guide for submitting a new Request for funding](https://wiki.aragon.one/nest/guides/guide_for_submitting_a_request_for_funding/)
