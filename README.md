## For people looking to get funding for their project
_To those working or who want to work on something that may be of interest for providing a grant_

### How do I find out if my project could be eligible for a grant?
1. Check the [**Proposals for grants**](https://github.com/aragon/nest/issues) for existing proposals
2. If you don’t find anything close to what you’re working on, [**submit a new proposal for a grant**](https://github.com/aragon/nest/issues/new) and **discuss** if we should consider it for a grant
3. See the [Guide for submitting a new request for funding](https://wiki.aragon.one/nest/guides/guide_for_submitting_a_request_for_funding/) and follow these steps:
    - Fork the [Aragon Nest GitHub repository](https://github.com/aragon/nest)
    - Create a new directory with **your project’s name** inside the `grants/` folder. 
    - Inside that, create two files, `team.md` and `roadmap.md`, where you present **your team** and **suggested roadmap**
    - **Create a Pull Request** to merge your submission into the Nest repository. In that Pull Request, be sure to fill in **all the relevant info** described in the Pull Request Guide.md
> _Proposals should abstractly describe problems or products, not their implementations_

### I’m working on something that already has an existing proposal
If there’s already an [existing proposal for grants](https://github.com/aragon/nest/issues) that fits into what you’re building, follow the steps mentioned in the [Guide for submitting a new request for funding](https://wiki.aragon.one/nest/guides/guide_for_submitting_a_request_for_funding/)

## For people who have an idea that could benefit the ecosystem
### How to submit a proposal for a grant?
- Make sure the [Proposals for grants](https://github.com/aragon/nest/issues) doesn’t have an existing proposals for something similar to your proposal. If there is an existing one that is close to your idea, join in the discussion of that Proposal to see if yours could be integrated into the existing one, or if you should create a new proposal
- If nothing similar exists, create [a new Proposal for grants](https://github.com/aragon/nest/issues/new) at the [Nest Repository](https://github.com/aragon/nest/) and fill it out in detail following the [Guide for submitting a proposal for grants](https://wiki.aragon.one/nest/guides/guide_for_submitting_a_proposal_for_grants/)

### Engage the community and discuss! The community, [Aragon](https://aragon.one) and [Placeholder](https://twitter.com/placeholdervc) will review the submissions and get back to you
