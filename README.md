## How to request funding

If you happen to work or want to work on something that may interest us for a grant:

1. Check out current [proposals for grants](https://github.com/aragon/nest/issues)
   1. If you don't find anything close to what you're doing, you can [open a new proposal](https://github.com/aragon/nest/issues/new) and discuss if we should consider it for a grant. Proposals should abstractly describe problems or products, not their implementations (that'd be step 2)
2. If there's a proposal that fits into what you're building
   1. Fork the repo, create a directory inside `grants` with your project's name, and create two files, `team.md` and `roadmap.md`, where you present your team and suggested roadmap
   2. [Create a pull request](https://github.com/aragon/nest/compare) to merge your branch into the repo, and fill all the relevant data inside the pull request template for requesting funding
3. Engage the community and discuss! The community, [Aragon](https://aragon.one) and [Placeholder](https://twitter.com/placeholdervc) will review it and get back to you
