# Aragon Nest

![](https://wiki.aragon.one/design/artwork/Nest/01.png)

> **A grants program to support the development of the ecosystem.**

Aragon Nest is brought to you by your friends at [Aragon](https://aragon.one) and [Placeholder](https://twitter.com/placeholdervc).

The goal of the program is to attract talent to research and build the necessary tooling for developing solutions around Aragon and Ethereum. There are a lot of people and teams out there who just want to create great things without worrying about money. Not every project needs an ICO, not every team needs a business model, and not every piece of software needs a team or an employer. The Nest program was created to meet circumstances like these and provide funding to those who wish to step up and construct such relevant software or non-software solutions. We are not interested in funding startups or monetizable solutions.

## How to submit a proposal for a grant?

1. Make sure the [Proposals for grants](https://github.com/aragon/nest/issues) don’t have an existing proposal for something similar to your idea or project. If there is a proposal close to your idea or project, join the discussion of that Proposal to see if your idea or project could be integrated into the existing one, or if you should create a new proposal

2. If nothing similar exists, create [a new Proposal for grants](https://github.com/aragon/nest/issues/new) at the [Nest Repository](https://github.com/aragon/nest/), fill it out in detail following the [Guide for submitting a proposal for grants](Guide_for_submitting_a_proposal_for_grants.md) and **discuss** if we should consider it for a grant

3. After step 1 or 2, if you feel ready to apply for a grant see the [Guide for submitting a new request for funding](Guide_for_submitting_a_request_for_funding.md) and follow these steps:
    - Fork the [Aragon Nest GitHub repository](https://github.com/aragon/nest)
    - Create a new directory with **your project’s name** inside the `grants/` folder.
    - Inside that, create two files, [`team.md`](.github/templates/team.md) and [`roadmap.md`](.github/templates/team.md), where you present **your team** and **suggested roadmap**
    - **Create a Pull Request** to merge your submission into the Nest repository. In that Pull Request, be sure to fill in **all the relevant info** described in the [Guide for submitting a new Request for funding](Guide_for_submitting_a_request_for_funding.md)

> _Proposals should abstractly describe problems or products, not their implementations_

The difference between the **proposal stage** and the **request for funding stage** is that in the proposal stage we will focus on determing if the **idea is worth pursuing** and should be considered for a grant. In the request for funding stage we focus on determining if **the team will be able to deliver and the feasibility of the timeline/roadmap, milestones and deliverables**.

### Grant sizes
**Funding**: Up to $100,000 in ETH, split into chunks paid out over achieved deliverables.

 **Success reward**: Up to $50,000 in ANT, given out when all deliverables are ready.

### Engage the community and discuss! The community and [Aragon](https://aragon.org) will review the submissions and get back to you
