<br>

## Team

Name of the project lead

Email address of the project lead (whoever is filling out this application)

List each other member that is/would be working on this project (LinkedIn/GitHub profiles are preferred but not required)

What are the main roles of each team member?

Has the team already worked together? (please provide details)

Is your team already present on the Aragon Forum? If Yes, what are your usernames?

<br>

## Progress

How far along are you?

Is anyone using your product/application?

If yes, How many active users do you have and what kind of feedback have you received?

If you've applied previously with the same idea, how much progress have you made since the last time you applied? What has changed?

<br>

## Idea Problem

Why did you pick this idea to work on? Do you have domain expertise in this area?

What's new about what you're making? What do people resort to because it doesn't exist yet (or they don't know about it)?

Have you talked to people about what you're making? Do people want it and do you have examples of this?

<br>

## Market

What is the target market or end user in mind for this project?

What are the alternatives or competitors to this project?

How will this project get users? If your project is the type that faces a chicken-and-egg problem in the sense that it won't be attractive to users until it has a lot of users (e.g. a marketplace), how will you overcome that?

<br>

## Legal

Will you be using an Aragon DAO for operating this project and receiving the funds? Yes/No

Are any of the project team members covered by non-competes or intellectual property agreements that overlap with your project? If so, please explain.

<br>

## Aragon

Why do you think Aragon is a good fit for this project?

Are there any existing Aragon projects that are similar or complementary to your project?

<br>

## Funding

How much money are you requesting as a grant? (the maximum grant size we provide is $150k in USD value)

Have you already received any grants or funds from 3rd parties? If yes, how much?

Are you applying for funding to any other DAO platforms or grant programs? If so, that is not a problem as it increases the likelihood of your success, but it's important that we can take that into consideration if your project relies on multiple grants.

How do you plan to deploy grant funds? (split between research/development/marketing/etc)

What is your expected monthly burn rate?

Do you think this project will require additional funds once you have depleted the grant funds? If so, why? Where do you plan on acquiring further funding?

<br>

## Roadmap

How long do you plan on working on this project before shipping?

What are the key milestones you have to accomplish before you can ship a production ready product to users?

<br>
